# 📊 TalkWithData: AI-Powered CSV Visualization Generator

**TalkWithData** simplifies data exploration for everyone — no coding needed. Upload a CSV file and instantly see context-aware charts and the code that generated them, all powered by AI.

---

## 🌟 Inspiration

We noticed that many students and professionals struggle to interpret raw CSV files. Creating visualizations often requires programming knowledge, which can be a barrier. Our goal: make data analysis as simple as dragging and dropping a file.

---

## 🚀 What It Does

- Upload a **CSV file** to receive **intelligent visualizations** (e.g. heatmaps, bar charts, scatter plots).
- Each visualization includes a **summary**, **AI-generated plot**, and the **Python code** used to create it.
- Uses **Google Gemini AI** to understand data context and generate meaningful visual insights.

---

## 🧱 How We Built It

- **Frontend**: Built with **React.js**, allowing CSV upload and dynamic display of charts and code.
- **Backend**: Powered by **Flask**, uses **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to create plots and return them as base64-encoded images.
- **AI Integration**: Utilized **Google Gemini AI** to suggest the most relevant visualizations.
- **Communication**: Configured **CORS** to ensure seamless interaction between frontend and backend.

---

## 🧗 Challenges We Overcame

- Handling **CORS issues** between the frontend and backend.
- Parsing inconsistent or messy **real-world CSV data**.
- Ensuring **AI-generated Python code** is executable and safe.
- Maintaining a smooth UX even with **large file uploads**.

---

## ✅ Accomplishments

- Created a **zero-code interface** for high-quality data insights.
- Built a complete pipeline from file upload to AI-generated visual outputs.
- Delivered a visually pleasing and accessible app experience.

---

## 📚 What We Learned

- Effective **frontend-backend communication** for file handling and visualization delivery.
- AI prompt engineering for **code generation and context understanding**.
- Techniques to manage and visualize **edge-case data scenarios** gracefully.

---

## 🔮 What’s Next

- 💬 Natural language questions like “Which country has the highest revenue?”
- 📂 Support for **Excel** and **JSON** formats.
- 🎨 Customization options for users to tweak chart types and styles.
- ☁️ Cloud deployment with **team sharing & collaboration features**.

---
